# game task project

 Welcome to the game task project!


## Set up:
 - Step 1: clone this repo
 - Step 2: open the project using Unity 2020.3.30 or higher
 - Step 3: navigate to the Assets/Scenes directory, and open the MainScene
 - Step 4: Press Play and enjoy the game!


## Project Structure:
All the assets are in folders based on their type (e.g. Assets/Prefabs, Assets/Scenes, Assets/Scripts etc..)\
Within those may be sub-folders based on more specific areas of use:\
(e.g. Scripts/Game vs Scripts/UI  or Sounds/LevelScene vs Sounds/MainScene)\
Assets/Resources contains the files that are loaded at runtime, in 2 folders: LevelData and UIDialogs


### Note about the Level File Validation:
All the functionality and features in the project can be experienced by playing the game, except for the\
Level File Validation. To see that in action, just click on the Unity menu item here:\
**Assets->Validate All Level Files**\
It will show the output in the console. All the current level files in the project pass the validation checks!
